    Route input quantum circuit. It inserts SWAP operations on a circuit to make two-qubits operations compatible with a given coupling map that restricts the pair of qubits on which operations can be applied.
    It should be used as an initial step before any other AI synthesis routine.

    Args:
        circuit_qasm: quantum circuit as QASM string to be synthesized.
        backend_name: Qiskit Runtime Service backend name on which to map the input circuit synthesis
        optimization_level: The potential optimization level to apply during the transpilation process. Valid values are [1,2,3], where 1 is the least optimization (and fastest), and 3 the most optimization (and most time-intensive)
        layout_mode: specifies how to handle the layout selection. It can assume the following values:
            - keep: This respects the layout set by the previous transpiler passes. Typically used when the circuit must be run on specific qubits of the device. It often produces worse results because it has less room for optimization.
            - improve: It is useful when you have a good initial guess for the layout
            - optimize: This is the default mode. It works best for general circuits where you might not have good layout guesses. This mode ignores previous layout selections.
        optimization_preferences: indicates what you want to reduce through optimization: number of cnot gates (n_cnots), number of gates (n_gates), number of cnots layers (cnot_layers), number of layers (layers), and/or noise (noise)
        local_mode: determines where the AIRouting pass runs. If False, AIRouting runs remotely through the Qiskit Transpiler Service. If True, the package tries to run the pass in your local environment with a fallback to cloud mode if the required dependencies are not found
